# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
- The target variable in this model: "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column
- The features variable(s) in this model:
    - APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
    - AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
    - CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
    - USE_CASE—Use case for funding
    - ORGANIZATION—Organization type
    - STATUS—Active status
    - INCOME_AMT—Income classification
    - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
    - ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- The variables are removed from the input data: "EIN" and "NAME"
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
